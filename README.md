<b>Hello, I'm @mvoyles </b></br>
I am currently learning Python and SQL </br>
I am exploring many applications of these languages and hope to grow to be a better developer. My current projects involve delving further into the pandas python library, 
building databases and data analysis.</br>
The big project I'm working on right now is building a budgeting app that will replace my own personal budgeting methods, which are currently Excel sheets.</br>
